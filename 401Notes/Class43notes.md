Gatsby and next.js Resources

1. Teach us two things about Next.js. 
  Next.js is a framework that solves many of the issues or considerations that come with building a React application from scratch including:
     - Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
     - You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
     - You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. - - You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
     - You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

    Next.js has built in features including:
     - An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
     - Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
