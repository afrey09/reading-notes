Psychological Safety

1. Three factors that contribute to psychological safety in teams:

    vulnerability
    humility
    mutual respect

2. When I was in nursing school in 2014-2015, I was initially very excited to be a part of my cohort. It felt like there were 25 people that I could have made into a support system so we could all help each other get through the program. Shortly after the program began however, and despite my best efforts to cultivate what I was hoping for, I realized a large portion of the class, as well as the bulk of the staff, preferred to have an, "every man for themselves," perspective. I would try to suggest study groups or seek guidance from those I knew were understanding the topic at hand better and I was continually met with negativity and deflection. In addition, it started to feel like clicks were forming and for whatever reason, I was frequently and indirectly reminded that I was not welcome. Nursing school was immensely stressful but the lack of support and psychological safety I felt within that cohort magnified the stress significantly. I think it absolutely played a part in my feeling like there was no way I could get through nursing school when I found out I was pregnant. Rather than finding comfort and confidence in knowing I had a team behind me, I felt profoundly alone.

3. Through Google's research, it was determined that groups with psychological safety have high levels of productivity and success rates within the company. They often generate the most business and have the best numbers. It turns out that when individuals feel valued, cared for and seen, they are able to operate optimally.
