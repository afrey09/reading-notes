The reason HTML TABLES should not be used for page layouts:

  -layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
  -tables produce tag soup, making it harder to read, maintain and debug
  -tables are not automatically responsive

Constructors are functions called using the keyword new. When calling a constructor, it will:

  -create a new object
  -bind "this" to the new object, so you can refer to "this" in your constructor code
  -run the code in the constructor
  -return the new object

They are helpful when you have to create several object literals and you want to use the same method definition for each.

This - "This" keyword refers to the current object the code is being written in. When you call a constructor however, it will take "this" and bind it to the new object, so that you are able to refer to it in the constructor code, as well.
