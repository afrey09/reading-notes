NODE JS

Intro to Node

1. Home page definition: "Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine." 
  
  Stack Overload definition: "Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library."

2. Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine compiles JavaScript and converts it into code that your computer recognizes and is able to execute. It is an "open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers.." 

(Node programs are not executed in the browser)

3. JavaScript runtime essentially means that Node.js is a program used to execute JS on our computers.

4. npm: "a package manager that comes bundled with Node..a program that allows you to install multple versons of Node and switch between them at will."

5. The Node version running on my computer is v19.3.0

6. The npm version running on my computer is 9.2.0

7. npm install -g jshint installs the jshint library/package

8. Node is used to run various build tools that are "designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application." Node is relied upont to "create a sensible development environment" in which to run frameworks.

6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater efficiency
   Engaged collaboration
   Learning from fellow students
   Social skills
   Job interview readiness
   Work environment readiness

2. I have found greater efficiency to be very true, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students and social skills. However, I'm not confident enough yet to say I feel it's helped me feel job interview ready. And I can see how it will obviously prepare me for the actual work environment but I'm not yet to that point.

3. There is typically a navigator and a driver. The driver is the one typing while the navigator uses words to guide the driver but isn't actually typing anything or providing direct input to the computer.
