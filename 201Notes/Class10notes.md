Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Key differences between Syntax and Logic error:

  "Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
  Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error." Logic errors are more like processing errors or do not contain the proper code. Whereas Syntax errors may have minor typos which is causing the code to not properly run.

2. The errors I have experienced, both syntax and logic, I have solved through looking in the console and viewing the line and character given so that I am able to go back directly to the line of code causing the problem and work with either TA, teacher or classmate help to troubleshoot the issue. If it's a syntax error, those are quicker to pinpoint. The logic errors, I am still learning to recognize and troubleshoot with help.

3. This effects my future goals because a huge piece to software development is troubleshooting. Without knowing how to troubleshoot and work through problematic code, you basically wouldn't have a job.

JS Debugger

The debugger tool is a tool used to try to help troubleshoot problems within your code to determine why it is not executing. It allows you to set breakpoints in your code ("places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly"). So say you have 50 lines of code but you need to pinpoint where the problem is occuring. You could set a breakpoint after ten lines of code so that only those first ten lines are run and will spit out potential errors within them.

Callstack: "The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.:

Scopes: "shows what values are visible from various points within your code. For example, in the image below, you can see the objects available to the code in the addItemClick function."
