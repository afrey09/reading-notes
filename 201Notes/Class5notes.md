HTML Media

 The attribute alt is intented for textual description of an image. The attribute src is where either relative url or absolute url will live. 

 To improve accessibility of images in an HTML document, include an alt tag

 Figure elements include figcaptions which is the caption for your image. It acts as the parent to the image and figcaption.

 The difference between a gif image and an svg image is that svg images have resolution-independence. This means that they will always look super crisp and clear, regardless of the screen resolution.

 The image type you would use to display a screenshot on your website would be PNG or lossless WebP for compressed images. For diagrams, drawings and charts, SVG is preferred with PNG as fallback. These allow for the quality to not be compromised.

 CSS - Color & Styling HTML Text Elements

 The difference between foreground and background color of an HTML element is that foreground typically refers to the text color. The color property in CSS refers to the foreground or text coloring whereas background refers to the background color.

If a friend asked me to give his colorless blog a touch up, I would utilize the color and background properties to give both his text and background some coloring. You can also create more visual appeal by giving your h1, h2 elements different coloring.

Font-family is the property used to pick various fonts. When selecting a font, you should first consider which fonts are widley accepted across all systems. These are referred to as web safe fonts. 

Font-size refers to the pixels selected for the font and is an absolute unit. You can also use em, which will adopt the size of the closest parent element. The font-weight will effect level of boldness. Font-style include normal, italics or oblique. Font style therefore can be turned on or off.

To add spacing around an h1 element you can use text-align as well as line-height. Adding space within the letters can be achieved using letter-spacing or word-spacing.
