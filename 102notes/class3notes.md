Git repositories - your websites

Cloning - Copying the HTTPS into VS Code where you can then edit and modify within your local computer system

    "By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project."

To clone a repository into a directory with another name of your choosing, use the following command format:

$ git clone https://github.com/test mydirectory
The command above makes a copy of the target repository in a directory named “mydirectory.”

From terminal, once changes are made in VS, you must then go in and ACP all changes to send them back over to GitHub
