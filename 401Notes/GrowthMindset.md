  The videos and reading each discussed ways to essentially shift your perspectives whether on your self worth, your level of grit or determination, your ability to learn and become more intelligent, and how we measure success both for ourselves and others. Having a fixed mindset or way of thinking about problems only inhibits us from being able to grow. Growth requires an openness to humility and admitting that we always have more to learn, areas of ourselves that need work and that often there are better ways of doing things. In the studies mentioned in the material, circumstances the background of individual's lives didn't play as big of a factor as initially anticipated. Getting people to believe in their capability, to see themselves as able and cultivating a level of grit or determination were some of the biggest indicators for success. But all that being said, it's important to remember that not all opportunities are equal and judging someone as though they are solely responsible for their status in life is cruel and unfair. Having a fixed mindset such as that can often lead to higher rates of suicide and self-hatred, according to the kinder, gentler philosophy of success talk. But I think overall, the message is that always working on our levels of self-awareness, our implicit biases and our desire and willingness to grow and evolve is crucial in living out a well-balanced and fulfilling life both personally and professionally.

  Assessments:

  I did not go back to look at my scores from the times I previously took these assessments but I'm fairly confident the scores are relatively the same. If anything, I think I may actually have a lower score in the emotional intelligence assessment; not significantly but some. The last couple months have been difficult for me and I think it some ways it is making me feel less certain of pieces of myself. I also think some of the questions are in areas where growth opportunities weren't necessarily presented over the time since last taking the assessment. for example, my lowest score was a 10 in the 4 ways to act for the bias assessment. One of the questions is about seeking our committee or mentor program within your work to address bias issues. So my score for that was the same as before. But overall, I still think I am in a good spot in the areas of emotional intelligence and bias. Obviously there's always more work that could be done and ways to grow. But I feel confident I am doing what's within my control right now to maintain awareness and openness to growth.
