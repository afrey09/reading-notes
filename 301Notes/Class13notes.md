1. What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD? "CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands. It is a way of creating, modifying, and deleting information for the user. CRUD functions can exist in a REST API, but REST APIs are not limited to CRUD functions"
