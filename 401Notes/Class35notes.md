Vocab List:

 Graph - A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
5. Undirected Graph - An undirected graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
6. Directed Graph (Digraph) - A directed graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
7. Complete Graph - A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
8. Connected - A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
9. Disconnected - A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
10. Acyclic Graph - An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.
11. Cyclic Graph - A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.
12. Adjacency Matrix - An adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix
13. Adjacency List - An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.
14. Weighted Graphs - A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
15. Traversal - Traversal is a general term for searching a data structure.
  1. Breadth First - Breadth first traversal iterates through the graph by going through each level of the graph node-by-node.
  2. Depth First - Depth first traversal iterates through the graph by going deep down each branch before going to the next branch.
