AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

AWS API Gateway Overview

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?
  "Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic."

2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?
  "API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and API definitions. Being able to trigger the execution of a Serverless function directly in response to an HTTP request is the key reason why API Gateway is so valuable in Serverless setups"

3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?
  "...it enables a truly serverless architecture for web applications. When using API Gateway together with other AWS services, itâ€™s possible to build a fully functional customer-facing web application without maintaining a single server yourself."
