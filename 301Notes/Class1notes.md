Component-Based Architecture

  "A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface."

  "A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture."

  "A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties."

  Views - Can have object-oriented view, conventional view and process-related view.

  Characteristics of a component include:

    - Reusability
    - Replaceable
    - Not context specific
    - Extensible
    - Encapsulated
    - Independent

  Advantages to using component-based architecture:

    - Ease of deployment
    - Reduced cost
    - Ease of development
    - Reusable
    - Modification of technical complexity
    - Reliability
    - System maintenance and evolution
    - Independent

  Props are used to pass data from one component to another
  The flow of props or the direction the data is being passed is uni-directional, meaning only from the parent to child
