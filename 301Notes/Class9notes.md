Functional Programming

1. "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia"

2. Pure function definition and two parameters for being considered pure:

  - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as    deterministic)
  - It does not cause any observable side effects

3. Benefits of pure function:

  - The code is easier to test
  - You don't have to mock anything

4. Immutability: unchanging over time or unable to be changed

5. Referential Transparency: When a function consistently yields the same result for the same input
