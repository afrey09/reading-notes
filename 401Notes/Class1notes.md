Additional Questions

Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
I am looking forward to improving my debugging capabilities. There are obviously a lot of pieces we will be learning this class but debugging feels like a pretty crucial skillset to have as a developer and I am nowhere near as confident would like to be by the end of this program.

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
My hope is continue to gain more confidence in my ability to tackle this material. I do not want to operate out of a place of initimdation all the time and be able to get to a place where I can see a problem or topic and break it down into bite sized pieces that feel more tangible to work with. I want to get to the end of the class feeling like I have the skillset employers are looking for and like I have the grip I need to as a junior developer.
