1. Roy Fielding : "He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser."

2. The techniques we use today don't work well to talk to all machines around the world because..., "they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements."

3. The HTTP Fielding and his friends created can be described as "a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns...The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed."

4. A GET is done by a browser on the URL to retrieve a webpage, using the HTTP protocol.

5. POST is used to add something to another system

6. PUT is used to replace something in another system

7. PATCH is used to do a partial update
