**My Reading Journal for 102**

My name is Adrienne Frey. I'm 33, have three daughters and have been married for 11 years. My background is in healthcare but I am now moving into software development with the hope of improving my quality of life in a multitude of areas. I enjoy problem solving, creating and caring for people and my aim is to utilize those passions in the software development world. I am very much intimidated to begin this gear change but am also very excited and ready for the challenge!

**Growth Mindset means to me..**

To have a growth mindset I think means to have self-awareness; awareness of how you learn, awareness of the self-talk that occurs whether positive or negative, an awareness of what environment helps you thrive or easily get distracted and essentially an awareness of what tools you need and skills you need to cultivate in order to have success with your endeavors. Having the understanding that you will experience down falls but not allowing them to easily deter you is what ultimately gets you back on track quicker and creates an habitual rebound from the negative pathways we so quickly fall into in our heads.

**3 Reminders to Keep Myself in Growth Mindset**

- > *No one is good at it when just beginning*
- > *It's meant to be hard. We grow by challenging ourselves*
- > *I can't figure it out...yet*
