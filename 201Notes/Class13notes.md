Local Storage and How to Use It on Websites

  A developer would use local storage in order to keep a key on the user's computer. It gives the developer more control. It also allows you to access the data quicker and maintain the state of an interface in a simpler way.

  Information you would never want stored locally is confidential information such as passwords, personal identifiers such as ss numbers, etc.

  Local storage can store strings. However, there is a work around to that problem where you are able to convert the type. Using JSON.stringify and JSON.parse methods allow you to pull apart and then reconstruct the data.
