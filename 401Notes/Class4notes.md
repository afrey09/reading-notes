nosql vs sql

1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?
  "SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment"

2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?
  "NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data."

3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.
  SQL: Vertical - "You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server"
  NoSQL: Horizontal - "You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic."

sql modeling techniques

1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?
  A one-to-many relationship is when a data entry in one table can be related to more than one entry in another. We show relationships by connecting lines between them.

2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___create   diagrams ___ of the database tables and their relationships.

3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.
  primary keys: "uniquely identify each row in a table.  A table typically has one primary key, but can have more"
  foreign keys: "This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table."
