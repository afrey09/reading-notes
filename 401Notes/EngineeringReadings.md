What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?


What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Read and re-read the problem, writing it out and talking it through out loud until I understand what is being asked
2. Break it down into smaller steps until I am at a place where I can solve it. Then proceed to add on additional pieces until I am back to the original problem that needed to be solved.
3. Reframe the way I am seeing failure. I think a lot of times, when I am struggling, I quickly jump on the hampster wheel of negative self-talk. Reframing how I perceive failure will hopefully bolster my ability to implement helpful steps more quickly and allow me to still be productive in the midst of my confusion
