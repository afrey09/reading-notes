HTML - Hyperlinks

To create a hyperlink, we wrap text in an <a> element with the href attribute

Href contains the target or web address

To ensure links are accessible to all readers:

  Use clear link wording
  Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text
  Don't say link or links to in the link text
  Keep your link text as short as possible
  Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places.


CSS

Normal flow refers to the way elememts lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout

A few differences between block level and inline elements:

  "A block level element's contents fills the available inline space of the parent elementain containing it and grows along the block dimmension to accomodate its content"

  "The size of inline elements is just the size of their content.You can't set width or height on inline elements - they just sit inside the content of block level elements - except for images. Images can be resized without changing their display property."

  "Block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, which is based on the parent's writing mode (initial:horizonal-tb). Each element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified."

  "Inline elements behave differently. They don't appear on new lines; instead, they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content as long as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the parent block level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line."

  Static position is the default for every html element

  Advantages to using absolute position on an element include:

    You can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.

    Cross-browser support

  Key difference between absolute positioning and fixed positioning is that "absolute positioning fixes an element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one). Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport."

Functions

  Declaring the function is defining it. Invoking is to actually call it in order to get it to run.

  A parameter is the name listed in the function parentheses. But the argument are the values included inside the parentheses passed to the function. Not all functions require them.

Pair Programming

2 Benefits to pair programming:

  Greater efficiency - This I can definitely attest to, especially while I am in this early phase of learning. Having classmates jump in and look at my code and walk me through tips and suggestions has been instrumental in me actually understanding and retaining the information I am learning. They are able to point out pieces I wasn't aware of or even knew to look for. All of this would be taking me significantly longer to pick apart and understand if I didn't have other's working on it with me.

  Learning from Fellow Students - This is basically the same thing but I am learning a lot from seeing the way others process and interpret information. Gaining insight and seeing from other people's perspectives is invaluable in this whole process.
