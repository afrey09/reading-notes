LINKED LISTS

Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

BIG O

Logarithmic Complexity represents a function that sees a decrease in the rate of complexity growth, the greater our value of n

Linearithmic Complexity is used to describe a growth rate of n by lgn. This represents complexity that grows with n

Quadratic Complexity describes an algorithm with complexity growing at a rate of input size n multiplied by n

Cubic Complexity is typically just a higher degree of what makes the quadratic complexity grow at such a high rate

Exponential Complexity represents very rapidly growing complexity, such that whatever our input size n

Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers in which the previous 2 numbers add up to the next number in the sequence

Factorial Complexity means that the our space and time requirements grow extremely fast, relative to our input size.

Worst Case: The efficiency for the worst possible input of size n

Best Case: The efficiency for the best possible input of size n

Average Case: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size n

ASYMPTOTIC NOTATIONS

Big O(oh): This notation describes the Worst Case for an algorithm. The Order of Growth used represents the upper bounds of Time and Space.
Big Omega: This notation describes the Best Case for a given algorithm. The Order of Growth used represents the lower bounds of Time and Space.
Big Theta: This notation describes the Average Case. The Order of Growth used represents the tight bound of Time and Space.
