    Variables: var,let,const

        var- needed for operating old sites but not used 1995-2015
        let- changeable
        const- stays the same

    Variables are considered containers for storing data

    example:
    let x = 5
    let y = 6
    let z = x + y

So let x, is the container to store the value of 5
let y, the container to store the value of 6
and z, the container for x added to y

If you think the variable can change, use "let". If you think it will stay the same, such as your name, use const.
