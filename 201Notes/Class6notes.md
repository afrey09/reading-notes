Objects

Objects are containers to store specific information of both names and their values. If you wanted to store information from a fitbit watch for example, rather than just including the random values, you could include both the values and what they belong to.

Object Literals are beneficial because it allows you to transfer a series of structured related data items in some manner. The example given is sending a request to the server to be put into a database. This is much more efficient than sending them all individually.

Objects differ from arrays because you are able to provide more context and detailed information. You can select a property and then assign it a value within the object.

Brackets can be used over dot notation when you are wanting to select an item using the name associated with the value. If an object property name is within a variable, then you won't be able to use dot notation to access it and instead must use brackets.

This refers to dog, in the instance of the code provided. It is taking everything in the variable dog and accessing it using the word This.

DOM

DOM stands for document object model. It is where the broswer interprets HTML, JS and CSS as on big object.

DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JS language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts. All the various components of a document are parts of the DOM for that document. DOM is used to manipulate them with the JS language or the like.
