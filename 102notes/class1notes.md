Markdown is a toolbox on GitHub that provides you with ways to modify your project or website. Markdown syntax is essentially a book of translations that shows you which symbols create the intended affect.
Bookmarking the sites provided will be useful in the future as cheat sheets to reference when creating and modifying our websites.
The analogy given that GitHub is essentially like the cloud while VS Code is your local repository made a lot of sense to me. GitHub allows us to take the information from VS Code that we've used to create our websites and provides a launching point to then publish.
It also provides an abundance of information and tools needed to piece together web pages.
