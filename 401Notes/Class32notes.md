Context API - Behaviors

1. How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

Overall, useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application. useReducer consolidates the update logic for components. useContext allows you to pass information down deep within the tree without having to pass through ever single component. useReducer works well unless there is an abundance of components. In this case, implementing useContext allows you to declutter and allows the children deep within to access the logic directly from the parent component. Combining the two allows for less complicated management of state and a more fluid transference of important information.
