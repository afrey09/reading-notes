MongoDB and Mongoose

1.  Differences between

    SQL:
  - relational databases
  - table based
  - predefined schema
  - vertically scalable
  - uses structured query language for defining and manipulating the data

    NoSQL:
  - non-relational or distributed databases
  - databases are documents, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
  - dynamic schema
  - horizontally scalable
  - queries are focused on collection of documents

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? complex queries
3. Give a real world example. Oracle
4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Better for hierarchial data storage
5. Give a real world example. MongoDB
6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL
7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    "For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic"

1. What does SQL stand for? Structured query language
2. What is a relational database? It works with certain assumptions and supports SQL
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? Tables (like data bins)
4. What is a ‘schema’? A representation of a plan; an outline or model. Defined by fields
5. What is a NoSQL database? Non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational databases
6. How does it work? They store data in documents rather than tables
7. What is inside of a MongoDB database? Collections that are essentially tables. But inside the collections are documents
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why? MongoDB - There is no strict schema or structure. There are also no relations
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? You can't be confident that all the data adheres to your format but the fact that it doesn't have the format is what makes it flexible. You may also get duplicate data
