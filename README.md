**Growth Mindset means to me..**

To have a growth mindset I think means to have self-awareness; awareness of how you learn, awareness of the self-talk that occurs whether positive or negative, an awareness of what environment helps you thrive or easily get distracted and essentially an awareness of what tools you need and skills you need to cultivate in order to have success with your endeavors. Having the understanding that you will experience down falls but not allowing them to easily deter you is what ultimately gets you back on track quicker and creates an habitual rebound from the negative pathways we so quickly fall into in our heads.

**3 Reminders to Keep Myself in Growth Mindset**

- > *It's meant to be hard. We grow by challenging ourselves*
- > *I can't figure it out...yet*
